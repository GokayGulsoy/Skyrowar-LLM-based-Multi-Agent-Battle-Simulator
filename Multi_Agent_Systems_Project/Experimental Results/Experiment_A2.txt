With two teammates critically low on health (Onsimer and Breton both at 25 HP), I'm using Infight on Onsimer to boost Redguard to 2160 AP. This will eliminate Onsimer but create an overwhelming offensive threat. Onsimer's Heal passive won't save them from 75 damage at 25 HP. This sacrifice maximizes our damage output for a decisive strike next turn, as Redguard can then deal 2160+ damage with Basic Attack or enable Breton to use Subtle for protection while Redguard finishes the enemy team.", 'current_ap': 2020}
